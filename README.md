# VizingAlgoAnimation
This is a Unity3d project that animates Vizing's algorithm for edge coloring. Users can create, edit and draw their own graphs and watch the graphs being colored by Vizing's algorithm. 

This project supports only Windows for now. 

You can watch a video illustration [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TN8u8ALLmW9yyT7157lOKy-0KkI1QUeJ/view?usp=sharing). 

## Installation
Build the project in Unity2019.1.3f1, with target Windows. 

Alternatively, download complete builds from [here](https://github.com/zyyhhxx/VizingAlgoAnimation/tree/C%2B%2BBackend/Builds)

## Usage
Run the built project executable. 
Click on "Add a Vertex" to add a vertex. Then you can drag added vertex around using your mouse. Double-click on a vertex and then click on another vertex to form an edge between them. Right-click on a vertex to remove it. After you build a graph you want, clikc on "Color Edges" to have the Vizing Algo color the edges. Click on "Previous Step" and "Next Step" to move between steps. Click on "Back To Drawing" to go back to drawing the graph. 

## Credit
The C++ backend version of this project uses a [Vizing's algorithm implemented in C++](https://github.com/zyyhhxx/VizingAlgorithm) as the backend.
